* The content of this project:
  MyHashMap.java

* How to run HashMapImplementation:
  To run this program, simply clone MyHashMap.java listed to local directory, open a java IDE and choose the local directory as 
  the working space.

* Purpose:
  To mimic the behavior of the class hashmap. 

* Design:
  Using an array of LinkedList (Java class) to initialize MyHashMap with the specified initial capacity or with the capacity of 30 without any argument. 

  Once the load_Factor is reached, the map will be automatically expanded. Since MyHashMap takes generic types, the users should implement their own hashcode. 

  To be added, a KVPair is placed in an LinkedList with the corresponding hashcode%capacity. 

  To be removed, the hashcode of the target KVPair will be calculated and deleted from the corresponding LinkedList.

  To check if a certain KVPair is contained, the hashcode will be calculated and the program goes to the row with corresponding hashcode%capacity and searches for the target KVPair.

  The highlight is that this program also implements the iterator, which includes hashNext() and next().
